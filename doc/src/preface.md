# WOOD - Web Object Oriented Development

WOOD is a development tool for user interfaces based on web technologies. It uses HTML  and CSS  to describe user interface layout and and standard JavaScript to implement user interactions. There is no attempt to hide 'the low level details'  behind another layer of abstractions, choosing to deal with complexity by decomposition and reusability. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself and SoC - Separation of Concerns are core principles.
